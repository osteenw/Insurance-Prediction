        <p>A heatmap of the data shows the strongest correlation between smoking and charges.</p>
        <p>There is also a lesser
            correlation between BMI and age to charges. We will plot these factors vs. the charges below.</p><br />

        <div>
            <p>First we will plot a histogram to show the frequency of charges in different price buckets.</p>
            <p><img alt="Histogram of charges" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/hist_charges.png') }}"><br/>
                As shown in the histogram, most charges are less than $15,000, with the highest frequency of charges being around
                ~$5,000 or less.</p>
        </div>


        <div>
            <p><img alt="Smoker vs. Charges Plot"
                    src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/smoker_v_charges.png') }}"><br/>
                The scatter plot of smoker vs. charges shows how smokers are always charged greater than $10,000.
                Whereas we learned in the previous histogram that the highest frequency of charges are actually less than $5,000. This shows
                a huge cost increase for smokers.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
            <img alt="Age vs. Charges Plot" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/age_v_charges.png') }}"><br />
            Some correlation can also be seen of increased charges with an increase in age.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
            <img alt="BMI vs. Charges Plot" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/bmi_v_charges.png') }}"><br />
            Less of a correlation is apparent between BMI and charges.</p>
        </div>
