# Insurance-Prediction
Machine learning  was applied to create a web application to predict the potential medical cost billed by health insurance.

Regression analysis was applied to the supplied dataset to create a prediction model for hospital charges based on the health metrics.

The web application can be found on Heroku at the following link:
https://insurance-prediction964.herokuapp.com/


* Insurance-Prediction.ipynb - Contains a Jupyter notebook for the machine learning model creation, and linear regression analysis on the dataset.
* insurance.csv - Is the dataset from found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance
* app.py - Contains the python application to start the web server.


To run the application locally download or clone this repository. Make sure your machine has a python environment set up with the packages found in requirements.txt. Then run the app.py. `python3 app.py`
